In this project, I'll be working with data from the S&P500 Index. I will predict the future prices using Linear Regression machine learning algorithm. Then, I'll evaluate how good the prediction model is. 

S&P500 dataset dictionary:

- Date -- The date of the record.
- Open -- The opening price of the day (when trading starts).
- High -- The highest trade price during the day.
- Low -- The lowest trade price during the day.
- Close -- The closing price for the day (when trading is finished).
- Volume -- The number of shares traded.
- Adj Close -- The daily closing price, adjusted retroactively to include any corporate actions.
